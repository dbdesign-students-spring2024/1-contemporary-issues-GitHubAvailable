# West Virginia Legislators Reject Bill to Expand Law Enforcement Database of DNA
In this document, I discuss two articles that west Virginia legislators reject bill to expand law enforcement database of DNA and the claims made by both sides about why they are in favor or not in favor of the bill. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

# Article 1
In Fox News' article [West Virginia Legislators Reject Bill to Expand Law Enforcement Database of DNA](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/west-virginia-legislators-reject-bill-expand-law-enforcement-database-dna), points out that the bill was rejected partially because of "privacy concerns" and the possible conflict to the "protection against unreasonable searches and seizures" stated in the Fourth Amendment.

I think the key of whether this bill will cause privacy or legal issues is how will this database be used and how will the data be managed. It may not be a big trouble if the database is only used to store the DNA of who did commit a crime and help identify them when they are involved in similar cases, but whether it is worth the money to operate a database solely for this purpose is not explained in this article. If the database is also used for some other purposes without public awareness, it may cause unintended consequence.

# Article 2
Contrary to the point made in the previous article, News and Sentinels' article [Blood Pressure: Debate Breaks out in West Virginia House over DNA Collection, Moonshine Bill](https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2024/01/blood-pressure-debate-breaks-out-in-west-virginia-house-over-dna-collection-moonshine-bill/) points out such bill could help identify and arrest potential offenders more efficicently, espically repeated offenders as their DNA would have been stored in the database. Some supporters also mentions that this just makes the society safer without causing much trouble as one's DNA will not be taken if they never commit a crime.

I agree that such a database could make identifying suspects and repeated offenders more efficiently since the police could use one's DNA as key to quickly detemine identity of the suspect. However, while most people will not be influenced by the bill, this does not mean that it should get passed as the decision should be made after careful consideration of interests of related groups and the long-term development of the society.
